#Drone Control and Operations üöÅ -
This repository contains various scripts and code snippets related to the control, movement, and operation of drones using the Tello library. These codes are primarily developed for learning purposes while exploring drone programming concepts such as basic movements, image capturing, keyboard control, mapping, and surveillance.

Note: Some of the code has not been tested yet due to the unavailability of a physical drone, but the logic is designed for practical implementation once a drone is available.

Overview -
This project covers essential aspects of drone control using the DJI Tello drone. It demonstrates how to:

Control the drone's basic movements (e.g., takeoff, landing, and directional movements).
Capture images using the drone's camera.
Implement keyboard controls to fly the drone in real-time.
Map the drone's movement in a simulated 2D space using odometry principles.
Conduct basic surveillance by integrating camera feeds with movement.

Prerequisites -
DJI Tello drone (or Tello simulator)
Python 3.7+
OpenCV (for image processing)
djitellopy library (for drone control)
Numpy (for numerical calculations)
